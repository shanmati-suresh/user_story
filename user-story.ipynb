Functional Requirements\n3. Non-Functional Requirements\n4. User Roles\n5. Constraints\n6. Assumptions\n7. Glossary\n8. Appendices\n\n**Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the requirements for a Budget Calculator software application. The purpose of this application is to assist users in managing their budgets and expenses, with a focus on flexibility, user-friendly interface, and cross-platform compatibility.\n\n**2. Functional Requirements**\n\n2.1 **Budget and Timeframe**\n- The application should allow users to input a budget and timeframe for their project. The default budget and timeframe will be $1000 and 6 months, respectively, but users should have the ability to adjust these values as needed.\n\n2.2 **Dynamic Categories**\n- The application should allow users to add, remove, and rename expense categories as needed.\n\n2.3 **Cross-Platform Compatibility**\n- The application should be available as both a web-based and mobile application.\n\n2.4 **Expense Tracking**\n- The application should allow users to record and track their expenses within each category.\n\n2.5 **Budget Limits**\n- The application should allow users to set budget limits for each category.\n\n2.6 **Reports Generation**\n- The application should generate reports that summarize the user's expenses, budget status, and progress towards their timeframe.\n\n**3. Non-Functional Requirements**\n\n3.1 **Performance**\n- The application should be able to handle a large number of expenses without significant slowdown.\n\n3.2 **Usability**\n- The application should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate.\n\n3.3 **Security**\n- The application should securely store user data and protect it from unauthorized access.\n\n**4. User Roles**\n\n4.1 **User**\n- Users are individuals or organizations who will use the Budget Calculator to manage their budgets and expenses.\n\n**5. Constraints**\n\n5.1 **Budget Range**\n- The application is designed to accommodate budgets up to $10,000,000. If a user requires a budget range outside of this, additional development may be necessary.\n\n**6. Assumptions**\n\n6.1 **Internet Connection**\n- The application requires an internet connection to function, as it is both web-based and mobile.\n\n**7. Glossary**\n\n- **Budget**: The total amount of money allocated for a specific purpose.\n- **Expense**: An outflow of money or resources.\n- **Category**: A group of related expenses.\n- **Timeframe**: The period of time during which a budget is in effect.\n\n**8.
